Introduction
============

This is a demo showcasing how Postgres full-text search can be used in a Ruby on Rails application.  You can find out more about Postgres full-text search at [the official site](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/textsearch.html).

Most of the interesting code for this application can be found within the `app` and `db/migrate` folders.
